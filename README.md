This project is intended to determine the [__“Sharpe ratio.”__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) It was developed by Nobel Laureate [__William F. Sharpe__](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/william-f-sharpe.asp) and is used to help investors understand the [return of an investment]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) compared to its risk. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp) or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio. Subtracting the risk-free rate from the mean return allows an investor to better isolate the profits associated with risk-taking activities. The risk-free rate of return is the return on an investment with zero risk, meaning it's the return investors could expect for taking no risk. Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.
</p>In brief, the Sharpe ratio adjusts a portfolio’s past performance—or expected future performance—for the excess risk that was taken by the investor. A high Sharpe ratio is good when compared to similar portfolios or funds with lower returns. But, the Sharpe ratio has several weaknesses, including an assumption that investment returns are normally distributed. The returns in the financial markets are skewed away from the average because of a large number of surprising drops or spikes in prices. Additionally, the standard deviation assumes that price movements in either direction are equally risky.</p>
<p>The stock data of the two tech giants, Amazon and Facebook are used in this project. The data of the S&P 500 Index (which measures the performance of the 500 largest stocks in the U.S.) are also utilized instead of the risk-free rate.<p>
